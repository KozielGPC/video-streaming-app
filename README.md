Repository destinated to study how a video is streamed on demand

# Standard protocols for live streaming include:

- RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol): This was originally developed by Macromedia to transmit data between a Flash player and a server. Now it is used for streaming video data over the internet. Note that video conferencing applications like Skype use RTC (Real-Time Communication) protocol for lower latency.
- HLS (HTTP Live Streaming): It requires the H.264 or H.265 encoding. Apple devices accept only HLS format.
- DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP): DASH does not support Apple devices.
- Both HLS and DASH support adaptive bitrate streaming.
